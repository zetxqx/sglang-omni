# MOSS-TTS

[MOSS-TTS-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-TTS-v1.5) is a delay-pattern text-to-speech model from MOSI.AI and the OpenMOSS team. It reconstructs **24 kHz** speech and supports zero-shot voice cloning from reference audio, reference-less synthesis, long-form speech generation, streaming, token-level duration control, Pinyin/IPA pronunciation control, multilingual synthesis, and code-switching. The model supports **31 languages**, accepts language tags to guide multilingual generation, and supports inline pause markers such as `[pause 3.2s]` for explicit prosody control.

Architecturally, MOSS-TTS-v1.5 is the `delay-pattern` counterpart to [MOSS-TTS-Local-Transformer-v1.5](moss_tts_local.md). The Qwen3-8B backbone predicts one text stream plus 32 residual-vector-quantization (RVQ) audio codebooks with delay-pattern scheduling; the generated codes are de-delayed and reconstructed into waveform by the vocoder. In SGLang-Omni it runs as a `preprocessing → tts_engine → vocoder` pipeline served through the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/audio/speech` endpoint.

| Component | Spec |
|---|---|
| Architecture | `MossTTSDelayModel` (`moss_tts_delay`) |
| Backbone | Qwen3-8B autoregressive decoder (36 L, hidden=4096, GQA 32/8) |
| Audio tokens | 32-codebook RVQ depth with delay-pattern scheduling |
| Output audio | 24 kHz |
| Languages | 31 languages with optional language tags |
| Controls | Voice reference, target duration tokens, Pinyin/IPA, pause markers, style instructions |

## Prerequisites

Install `sglang-omni` by following [Installation](../get_started/installation.md), then
download the model (public, no token required):

```bash
hf download OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-TTS-v1.5
```

The processor ships with the checkpoint, so no extra TTS package is needed. Decoding base64
(data-URI) reference audio additionally requires `soundfile` (`uv pip install soundfile`).

## Server Configuration

The pipeline is `preprocessing → tts_engine → vocoder`.

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-TTS-v1.5 \
  --config examples/configs/moss_tts.yaml \
  --port 8000
```

The default model-specific layout keeps the FP32 reference encoder on CPU and
loads the GPU vocoder in BF16. This removes one codec copy from GPU and halves
the parameter memory of the remaining codec.

For the bounded 32 GB qualification layout, use:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-TTS-v1.5 \
  --config examples/configs/moss_tts_32gb.yaml \
  --port 8000
```

This configuration limits request concurrency and CUDA Graph capture to batch
size 1. It completed startup and reference-less non-streaming synthesis on one
RTX 5090 with 32,607 MiB, peaking at 26,939 MiB. Treat this as a measured
qualification point rather than a general claim for every 32 GB card.

For the directly measured 24 GB layout, use:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-TTS-v1.5 \
  --config examples/configs/moss_tts_24gb.yaml \
  --port 8000
```

This profile completed startup, CUDA Graph capture, reference and
reference-less synthesis, streaming, cancellation, and recovery on one RTX
4090 with 24,564 MiB. Peak sampled VRAM was 23,251 MiB, leaving a minimum of
960 MiB free. SGLang profiled an effective 6,708-token KV capacity below the
requested `max_total_tokens: 8192`. Treat this as a concurrency-1,
CUDA-Graph-cap-1 qualification point, not a broader 24 GB capacity claim.

Both policies can be changed explicitly through the preprocessing/vocoder
`runtime_overrides` entries when profiling another layout. Explicit `device`
values take precedence over the GPU selected by stage placement.

## Synthesizing Speech

### Basic Speech

MOSS-TTS can synthesize speech without a reference clip:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-TTS-v1.5",
    "voice": "default",
    "input": "SGLang-Omni is a great project!"
  }' \
  --output output.wav
```

### Voice Cloning

Provide a reference clip when you want voice cloning. The `references` field accepts `audio_path`
(a local path, HTTP URL, or base64 data URI) and `text` (the transcript of that clip). Supplying
the transcript materially improves cloning quality.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-TTS-v1.5",
    "voice": "default",
    "input": "SGLang-Omni is a great project!",
    "references": [{
      "audio_path": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhaochenyang20/seed-tts-eval-mini/resolve/main/en/prompt-wavs/common_voice_en_10119832.wav",
      "text": "We asked over twenty different people, and they all said it was his."
    }]
  }' \
  --output output.wav
```

`ref_audio` and `ref_text` are accepted as shorthand for `references[0].audio_path` and
`references[0].text`.

#### Python

```python
import requests

resp = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/speech",
    json={
        "model": "OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-TTS-v1.5",
        "voice": "default",
        "input": "Get the trust fund to the bank early.",
        "ref_audio": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhaochenyang20/seed-tts-eval-mini/resolve/main/en/prompt-wavs/common_voice_en_10119832.wav",
        "ref_text": "We asked over twenty different people, and they all said it was his.",
    },
)
resp.raise_for_status()
with open("output.wav", "wb") as f:
    f.write(resp.content)
```

### Reference Audio Sources

`audio_path` / `ref_audio` may be a local filesystem path readable by the server, an HTTP(S)
URL, or a base64 **data URI** (`data:audio/wav;base64,<...>`, decoded with `soundfile`):

```json
{"ref_audio": "data:audio/wav;base64,UklGR.....", "ref_text": "Transcript of the clip."}
```

### Streaming

Set `"stream": true` and `"response_format": "pcm"` to receive raw PCM audio
chunks in real time.

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-TTS-v1.5",
    "voice": "default",
    "input": "Get the trust fund to the bank early.",
    "ref_audio": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhaochenyang20/seed-tts-eval-mini/resolve/main/en/prompt-wavs/common_voice_en_10119832.wav",
    "ref_text": "We asked over twenty different people, and they all said it was his.",
    "stream": true,
    "response_format": "pcm"
  }' \
  --output output.pcm
```

### Duration Control

MOSS-TTS conditions on a target **duration token count** (codec frames; a larger count yields
longer audio). Set it with an inline `${token:N}` prefix on `input` (stripped before synthesis),
or with a `token_count` (alias `duration_tokens` / `tokens`) parameter. The count must be a
positive integer.

```json
{
  "model": "OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-TTS-v1.5",
  "voice": "default",
  "input": "${token:150}A sentence with an explicit duration target.",
  "ref_audio": "..."
}
```

If omitted, the model picks a duration on its own; the SeedTTS benchmark estimates one per
sample with `--token-count auto`.

### Text Markup, Style, and Language

Inline text markup that the model understands (for example `[pause Xs]`, pinyin, and IPA) is
passed through unchanged. An optional `instructions` (alias `instruct`) field carries a
free-text style directive, and an optional `language` hint biases the target language (omit it
to let the model infer from the text):

```json
{
  "model": "OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-TTS-v1.5",
  "voice": "default",
  "input": "今天天气不错 [pause 0.5s] 就该出去晒晒太阳。",
  "ref_audio": "...", "ref_text": "...",
  "language": "Chinese",
}
```

## Generation Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | served model | Served model identifier |
| `input` | (required) | Text to synthesize. It may carry a `${token:N}` duration prefix and inline markup |
| `voice` | `default` | Voice identifier |
| `references` | `null` | Reference clip for cloning. Each item has `audio_path` and `text` |
| `ref_audio` / `ref_text` | `null` | Shorthand for `references[0].audio_path` / `references[0].text` |
| `stream` | `false` | Stream raw PCM audio chunks |
| `language` | `null` | Optional target-language hint. Omit to let the model infer |
| `instructions` / `instruct` | `null` | Optional free-text style directive |
| `token_count` / `duration_tokens` / `tokens` | `null` | Target duration in codec frames. It must be `> 0` |
| `max_new_tokens` | `4096` | Maximum generated frames. An explicit value must be `> 0` |
| `temperature` | `1.5` text / `1.7` audio | Sampling temperature. A single `temperature` overrides both channels |
| `top_p` | `1.0` text / `0.8` audio | Top-p sampling. A single `top_p` overrides both channels |
| `top_k` | `50` text / `25` audio | Top-k sampling. A single `top_k` overrides both channels |
| `repetition_penalty` | `1.0` | Audio repetition penalty |
| `seed` | `null` | Non-negative integer. See [Seed Reproducibility](#seed-reproducibility) |

The per-channel fields (`text_temperature`, `audio_temperature`, `text_top_p`, `audio_top_p`,
`text_top_k`, `audio_top_k`, `audio_repetition_penalty`) are also accepted and take precedence
over the single-value aliases.

## Seed Reproducibility

MOSS-TTS samples each row, position, and codebook with `multinomial_with_seed`, deriving a
per-request seed from the public `seed` and combining it with a per-(step, channel) position. A
sampled token therefore depends only on its own seed and position — never on its batch
neighbours — so a fixed `seed` is reproducible at any concurrency, not just batch size 1.
Limitations:

- Reproducibility holds for a **fixed server configuration and hardware**. Floating-point
  non-determinism in the backbone (different batch shapes, GPU models, or kernels) can still
  change the logits, and thus the sampled tokens, across deployments.
- `seed` must be a non-negative integer; non-integer or negative values are rejected.
- Requests **without** a `seed` draw a fresh random per-request seed, so they are not
  reproducible across runs (but are still independent of batch neighbours).

## Benchmarking

MOSS-TTS clones from each prompt (`--ref-format references`) and estimates a per-sample duration
with `--token-count auto`. Run at `--max-concurrency 8`; higher concurrency regresses WER.

```bash
python -m benchmarks.eval.benchmark_tts_seedtts \
  --meta zhaochenyang20/seed-tts-eval-arrow \
  --model OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-TTS-v1.5 --port 8000 \
  --ref-format references --token-count auto \
  --output-dir results/moss_tts_en --lang en --max-concurrency 8
```

Use `--lang zh` for the Chinese split. See `benchmarks/README.md` for the full workflow.

## Benchmark Results

Seed-TTS-Eval full set (EN = 1088, ZH = 2020) on 1× H200, concurrency 8, `--token-count auto`.
WER is scored with HF Whisper-large-v3 (EN) / FunASR paraformer-zh (ZH). These are the reference
numbers tabulated in `benchmarks/eval/benchmark_tts_seedtts.py` (source: PR #609) — reproducible
references, not CI thresholds.

| Lang | WER (corpus) | WER (excl. >50%) | Latency mean / p95 (s) | RTF mean | Throughput (qps) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| EN | 1.68% | 1.32% (4 outliers) | 3.449 / 4.141 | 0.811 | 2.312 |
| ZH | 1.36% | 1.27% (2 outliers) | 3.608 / 4.153 | 0.635 | 2.213 |

A handful of utterances run away into a repetition loop (> 50% WER) and dominate the raw
micro-average; excluding them, corpus WER is ~1.3% in both languages, and per-sample median WER
is 0.00%.

## Known Limitations

- **Voice cloning depends on the reference.** Omit the reference for non-cloned speech; provide
  the transcript (`text` / `ref_text`) for the best speaker similarity when cloning.
- **Concurrency vs. WER.** Quality is best around `--max-concurrency 8`; higher concurrency
  regresses WER.
- **Rare runaway generation.** A small fraction of utterances can loop and generate up to
  `max_new_tokens`; setting a `token_count` (or lowering `max_new_tokens`) bounds the output.
- **Duration is a hint.** `${token:N}` / `token_count` steers length but is not an exact clip
  duration.

# Omni Model Usage

This guide uses [Qwen3-Omni](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct) as an example omni model with SGLang-Omni and the OpenAI-compatible API. Qwen3-Omni supports multi-modal input (text, image, audio) and can produce text-only or text + audio output depending on the mode.

## Prerequisites

Install `sglang-omni` by following [Installation](../get_started/installation.md).

## Text-Only Mode

Text-only mode runs the thinker pipeline on a single GPU. It accepts multi-modal input (text, image, audio) and produces text output only.

### Launch the Server

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct \
  --text-only \
  --port 8008
```

For MMSU-style audio-input / text-output benchmarks with short requests, use
the fused text-path config so the full text path stays inside one worker
process:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct \
  --config examples/configs/qwen3_omni_mmsu.yaml \
  --text-only \
  --port 8008
```

### Image and Text Input

Send an image with a text question to get a text response.

**cURL**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8008/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3-omni",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How many cars are there in the picture?"}],
    "images": ["tests/data/cars.jpg"],
    "modalities": ["text"],
    "max_tokens": 16
  }'
```

**Python**

```python
import requests

resp = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8008/v1/chat/completions",
    json={
        "model": "qwen3-omni",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How many cars are there in the picture?"}],
        "images": ["tests/data/cars.jpg"],
        "modalities": ["text"],
        "max_tokens": 16,
    },
)
resp.raise_for_status()
result = resp.json()
print(result["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

### Audio and Image Input

Send an audio file together with an image. The audio contains the spoken question ("How many cars are there in the picture?") and the model answers based on both inputs.

> **Note:** Set `"content": ""` (empty string) on the user message when all semantic content comes from audio, video, or images rather than text.

**cURL**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8008/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3-omni",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}],
    "images": ["tests/data/cars.jpg"],
    "audios": ["tests/data/query_to_cars.wav"],
    "modalities": ["text"],
    "max_tokens": 16
  }'
```

**Python**

```python
import requests

resp = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8008/v1/chat/completions",
    json={
        "model": "qwen3-omni",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}],
        "images": ["tests/data/cars.jpg"],
        "audios": ["tests/data/query_to_cars.wav"],
        "modalities": ["text"],
        "max_tokens": 16,
    },
)
resp.raise_for_status()
result = resp.json()
print(result["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

### Video and Audio Input

Send a video with a spoken audio question. The model watches the video, hears the question, and responds with text.

The Video-AMME CI benchmark uses this same modality combination: video input
plus a spoken question/options WAV, with only routing and answer-format
instructions in the text message.

**cURL**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8008/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3-omni",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}],
    "videos": ["tests/data/draw.mp4"],
    "audios": ["tests/data/query_to_draw.wav"],
    "modalities": ["text"],
    "max_tokens": 16
  }'
```

**Python**

```python
import requests

resp = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8008/v1/chat/completions",
    json={
        "model": "qwen3-omni",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ""}],
        "videos": ["tests/data/draw.mp4"],
        "audios": ["tests/data/query_to_draw.wav"],
        "modalities": ["text"],
        "max_tokens": 16,
    },
)
resp.raise_for_status()
result = resp.json()
print(result["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

## Speech Mode

Speech mode runs the full eight-stage pipeline on one or more GPUs. It produces
both text (from the thinker) and audio (from the talker) output.

### Launch the Server

Speech mode can run as a colocated one-GPU worker using the colocated config:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct \
  --config examples/configs/qwen3_omni_colocated_h20.yaml \
  --colocate \
  --port 8008
```

Use `examples/configs/qwen3_omni_colocated_h200.yaml` on single-H200 workers.

Exact-shape CUDA Graph replay is enabled by default for Qwen3-Omni Code2Wav.
The default stage config supplies a 2% typed GPU memory budget; colocated
example configs override it with their hardware-specific budget.

To disable replay, add this runtime override to the YAML config:

```yaml
runtime_overrides:
  code2wav:
    enable_cuda_graph: false
```

When replay is enabled, a custom Code2Wav stage must define
`runtime.resources.total_gpu_memory_fraction`; startup rejects a missing typed
budget before loading the model.

The feature derives the exact `B=1` threshold windows from
`stream_chunk_size` and `left_context_size`; the defaults capture
`T{10,20,30,35}`. Unsupported shapes and final stream tails run eagerly.
Capture-time incompatibilities also fall back to eager execution.

For manual multi-GPU placement, use the example script:

```bash
python examples/run_omni.py qwen3-speech-server \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct \
  --gpu-thinker 0 \
  --gpu-talker 1 \
  --gpu-code-predictor 1 \
  --gpu-code2wav 0 \
  --port 8008
```

Or use the CLI without `--text-only` for the standard speech pipeline:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct \
  --port 8008
```

By default, leave `mem_fraction_static` unset and let SGLang-Omni auto-size the
SGLang AR memory budget. If a specific machine needs manual tuning, you can pin
the value globally or per AR stage:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct \
  --port 8008 \
  --mem-fraction-static 0.88
```

Use per-stage flags when the thinker and talker need different budgets:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct \
  --port 8008 \
  --thinker-mem-fraction-static 0.88 \
  --talker-mem-fraction-static 0.88
```

The speech server launcher exposes the same per-stage controls:

```bash
python examples/run_omni.py qwen3-speech-server \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct \
  --gpu-thinker 0 \
  --gpu-talker 1 \
  --gpu-code-predictor 1 \
  --gpu-code2wav 0 \
  --port 8008 \
  --thinker-mem-fraction-static 0.88 \
  --talker-mem-fraction-static 0.88
```

`--mem-fraction-static` applies to both Qwen AR stages. Per-stage flags override
the global value for that stage. Values must be greater than `0` and less than
`1`.

The thinker admits up to 64 running requests by default. Use the
thinker-specific flag to lower or raise that limit in either text-only or
speech mode:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct \
  --thinker-max-running-requests 16
```

`--max-running-requests` continues to target the generation stage, which is the
talker in the Qwen3-Omni speech pipeline. To configure the thinker through a
pipeline YAML file instead, use the stage runtime override:

```yaml
runtime_overrides:
  thinker:
    server_args_overrides:
      max_running_requests: 16
```

### Speech Stage Placement

At concurrency 8, the talker is the heaviest speech stage: it holds its GPU
at about 86% median utilization. Give it a GPU of its own. The code2wav
vocoder is light by comparison (9–13% median utilization) and shares the
thinker's GPU by default. That default holds only when the thinker stays on
its own default GPU — a `--thinker-gpus` override moves the thinker alone,
not code2wav, so pass `--code2wav-gpu` explicitly too if you relocate the
thinker.

This is the default topology for `sgl-omni serve` without GPU overrides:
thinker alone, talker alone, code2wav on the thinker's GPU. When code2wav
shares the thinker's GPU, the thinker's auto-sized KV pool shrinks to make
room for it — about 4.3 GiB smaller, measured on H200, since the vocoder
itself needs roughly 1.4–1.6 GiB. That adjustment only happens for the
auto-sized budget: an explicitly pinned `--thinker-mem-fraction-static`
gets no automatic carve-out, so a tightly pinned fraction should leave
headroom for code2wav.

A concurrency-8 experiment held code2wav fixed on the thinker's GPU and
varied only the talker's placement, from sharing the thinker's GPU to
having its own. Every concurrent metric improved:

| metric (concurrency 8, two measured pairs) | talker shares the thinker's GPU | talker alone | change |
|---|---|---|---|
| wall-clock time | 22.8–24.1 s | 20.2–20.7 s | 9–16% lower |
| time to first audio (TTFA), p50 | 1.43–1.71 s | 0.99–1.20 s | 16–42% lower |
| TTFA, p90 | 2.66–2.70 s | 1.42–1.46 s | 46–47% lower |
| end-to-end latency, p50 | 10.04–10.05 s | 8.94–9.44 s | 6–11% lower |

A follow-up single-variable pair tested moving code2wav to its own GPU
instead, with the talker already isolated in both arms. Wall-clock time and
end-to-end latency were flat (−0.7% and −0.9%, well within noise for a
single interleaved pair) — giving the vocoder a dedicated GPU bought
nothing, which is why code2wav shares the thinker's GPU instead of getting
isolated like the talker.

Single-stream traffic (one request at a time) sees a different trade-off.
In the talker-placement experiment above, isolating the talker — moving it
off the thinker's GPU — made single-stream end-to-end latency 14–17% worse:
with one request in flight there is no contention to escape, while that
experiment's thinker-to-talker handoff started crossing a device boundary.
Single-stream TTFA still improved by about 30% (0.48–0.49 s to 0.34–0.35 s),
because the talker no longer waits its turn on a shared GPU. Both the old
and the new default layout already keep the thinker and talker on separate
GPUs, so these numbers describe that experiment's topology change, not the
default code2wav placement. Streaming TTS workloads should prefer this
layout regardless, since TTFA is the latency users notice first.

### Realtime Speech with Server VAD

The speech pipeline can stream spoken responses over `/v1/realtime`. Enable the
WebSocket endpoint on the standard speech pipeline:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct \
  --port 8008 \
  --enable-realtime
```

After connecting to `ws://localhost:8008/v1/realtime`, request text and audio
output:

```json
{
  "type": "session.update",
  "session": {
    "modalities": ["text", "audio"],
    "input_audio_format": "pcm16",
    "output_audio_format": "pcm16"
  }
}
```

Stream mono 16 kHz PCM16 input with `input_audio_buffer.append`. Server VAD
automatically commits each utterance and starts generation. Text arrives in
`response.text.delta` events; spoken output arrives as base64-encoded mono
24 kHz PCM16 in `response.audio.delta` events, followed by
`response.audio.done` and `response.done`.

Audio output is opt-in: sessions remain text-only unless both modalities are
requested. A thinker-only server rejects audio negotiation because it has no
`code2wav` stage.

For text-and-audio sessions, server-owned barge-in is enabled by default. When
server VAD emits `input_audio_buffer.speech_started`, the active response is
cancelled with reason `turn_detected`; its user transcription still completes
and enters conversation history before the next queued turn runs. Cancelled
assistant output is not added to conversation history.

Clients must stop buffered playback on `speech_started` and reject every later
`response.audio.delta` for that response until its `response.done`. If speech
starts before `response.created`, retain a pending-interruption flag and reject
the response when its ID arrives. Automatic barge-in ends with
`response.done.status="cancelled"` and reason `turn_detected`; explicit
`response.cancel` uses reason `client_cancelled`.

If assistant audio has already been scheduled for playback, the client must
also send `conversation.item.truncate` with the assistant `item_id` from
`response.audio.delta`, `content_index: 0`, and the played duration in
`audio_end_ms`. The server replies with `conversation.item.truncated` and
removes that assistant item from conversation history. The whole assistant
transcript is removed because the endpoint cannot align text with played audio.

Set `turn_detection.interrupt_response` to `false` in `session.update` to opt
out. This is the only `turn_detection` field applied dynamically by the current
endpoint. Server VAD remains fixed at its startup defaults; `threshold`,
`prefix_padding_ms`, and `silence_duration_ms` do not reconfigure it. Text-only
responses are not interrupted automatically.

The browser example in `playground/qwen-omni/realtime` captures microphone
input and lets the user select text-only output or text plus streamed PCM16
audio playback.

## Single-GPU FP8 on H100/H20

SGLang-Omni can also serve native FP8 Qwen3-Omni checkpoints. Native FP8 uses
the checkpoint quantization config when loading the thinker and talker AR stages,
while keeping the same Qwen3-Omni request format shown below.

For one-GPU H100/H20 colocated launch, use the FP8 colocated config:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --config examples/configs/qwen3_omni_fp8_colocated.yaml \
  --colocate \
  --model-name qwen3-omni \
  --port 8008
```

The config file contains the FP8 checkpoint path:
`marksverdhei/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-FP8`. You can still pass `--model-path` to
override the config value.

The FP8 path keeps dense FP8 GEMM on SGLang `auto` and defaults native FP8 MoE
to CUTLASS when supported. For Qwen3-Omni pipeline launches,
`SGLANG_JIT_DEEPGEMM_PRECOMPILE=0` is set as a default unless the operator has
already set that environment variable. This disables SGLang's all-M DeepGEMM
precompile session while keeping DeepGEMM available for dense FP8 GEMMs.

To opt back into SGLang's all-M DeepGEMM precompile behavior:

```bash
SGLANG_JIT_DEEPGEMM_PRECOMPILE=1 sgl-omni serve \
  --config examples/configs/qwen3_omni_fp8_colocated.yaml \
  --colocate \
  --model-name qwen3-omni \
  --port 8008
```

## Single-GPU AutoRound INT4 Thinker on H100/H20

SGLang-Omni also supports AutoRound INT4 quantized Qwen3-Omni checkpoints.
AutoRound uses a 4-bit quantization scheme with group size 128, significantly
reducing memory footprint compared to BF16 or FP8.

The public AutoRound checkpoint quantizes the thinker transformer layers. In
speech mode, the talker and code2wav stages load as BF16 from the same
checkpoint. For one-GPU H100/H20 colocated launch, use the colocated config
with the AutoRound checkpoint:

```bash
sgl-omni serve \
  --config examples/configs/qwen3_omni_colocated_h20.yaml \
  --colocate \
  --model-name qwen3-omni \
  --model-path Intel/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Instruct-int4-AutoRound \
  --port 8008
```

AutoRound quantization provides:
- **~50% memory reduction** compared to BF16 (from ~60GB to ~30GB)
- **~25% memory reduction** compared to FP8 (from ~40GB to ~30GB)
- **Accuracy at ultra-low bit widths**: maintains high accuracy even at 2–4 bits, requiring minimal tuning effort thanks to its sign-gradient descent optimization.

### Image and Text Input

Send an image with a text question to get both text and audio responses. Set `"modalities": ["text", "audio"]` to enable audio output.

**cURL**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8008/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3-omni",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How many cars are there in the picture?"}],
    "images": ["tests/data/cars.jpg"],
    "modalities": ["text", "audio"],
    "max_tokens": 16
  }'
```

**Python**

```python
